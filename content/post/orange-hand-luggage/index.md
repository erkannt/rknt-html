## Learning and what I'd do different

- french seams are a great way to join bag pieces that avoids having to bind edges with tape
- single vertical pleat means stuff pockets taper too much at the bottom limiting their capacity
- taller stuff pockets = better stuff pockets
- taller rolltop part = better rolltop
- remember to insert all webbing loops to panels before joining panels
- Ryanair small size is tiny (but enough for a weekend)

## Construction

Basic order of operations:

- make pockets
- attach pockets, webbing (I forgot those) and straps to sides
- laptop sleeve
	- tack back outer to side at top and bottom
	- insert side zip between tacks
	- attach back of sleeve to back of pack at zip seam
	- reinforce side panel lining with webbing
	- attach side lining and front of sleeve to other zip side
	- join side lining with side outer on remaining edges
	- attach handle to side pocket
	- attach webbing in between laptop sleeve parts (I forgot and it now is visible inside the pack)
  - complete laptop sleeve by stitching sleeve parts to back along bottom and side
	- attach other side panel to back
- front and bottom
  - sandwich both ends of pocket zip with outer and liner
  - attach outer and its lining to either side of the zip (could have sandwiched here to have it neater)
	- top stitch around zip
	- insert channel at top of inner pocket piece
	- attach pocket piece to front at bottom and sides
	- stitch through pocket piece and top of zip to create upper inner pocket
	- sandwich front panel with outer and lining of bottom
- join panels
  - left sides i.e. inners together stitch with a small seam allowance all around
  - turn back inside out and stitch at approx 1/4" to finish french seam
- finish back
  - insert back foam
  - stitch at top of back to close foam compartment
	- attach shoulder straps and handle, tacking through all back layers including webbing
- roll top
	- attach webbing to roll top back lining to to have a place for closure loop
	- create outer and lining loops by joining roll top backs to their front/side pieces
	- sandwich top of rest of back between outer and lining of roll top
	- fold up rolltop and topstitch
	- attach rolltop closure loop
	- attach webbing or plastic strip to front of roll top to ease rolling
	- enclose edges with tape
