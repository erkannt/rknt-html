title: Parametric laser cut lamp

{{ pic(path="lamp.jpg") }}

A parametric lamp in 3mm lasercut plywood. I designed this in Rhino Grasshopper. Only ever made a triangular version but in theory other n-gons, heights and degrees of twist should work. The Grasshopper code also labels all the parts for assembly.
