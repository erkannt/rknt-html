A re-imagining of my [old faithful duffel]('/post/red-duffel').

## Features

- parametric Seamly pattern
- handles sized for carrying as backpack
- easy loading/unloading with full-circumference zip
- stuff pocket for bottles etc and zipped 3D-side pocket

## Pattern

- [Seamly file](./yellow-luggage.val)
- [60x40x20 params](./60x40x25.vit)
- [25x25x10 params](./25x15x10.vit)
- multipage [PDF](./yellow-luggage_pieces.pdf) and [SVG](./yellow-luggage_pieces.svg)
- [public domain licensed](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)

## Assembly guide

1. construct zip pocket and stuff pucket (e.g. insert extra elastic)
2. topstitch side pockets onto side panels (raw edges will be covered by handles and other panels)
3. attach sides to top panels with flat-felled seams
4. attach handles
   - tack through flat-felled seam of top panel
   - avoid having foam at the end of the handle that will dissappear into the bottom panel flat-felled seam
5. attach bottom panel to sides with flat-felled seam
6. join top panel at ends with a french-seam
7. insert zip and webbing for end hooks
8. insert end panels
   - regular right-side-to-right-side seams to be wrapped in seam tape to enclose raw edges
   - don't forget to add the webbing loops for the hooks
9. size and join the handles 

## What I'd change

- replace the curved zip line with a straight to create more tension (you can see the zip puffs out unnecessarily)
- de-bulk the straps before putting them in the flat-fell seam
- make a smaller version


## My version

- 60cm x 40cm x 25cm
- lightweight coated ripstop nylon
- tyvek lining
- main seams flat-felled
