{{ pic(path="./final.jpg") }}

A re-imagining of my [old faithful duffel]('/post/red-duffel').

## Features

- parametric Seamly pattern
- handles sized for carrying as backpack
- easy loading/unloading with full-circumference zip
- stuff pocket for bottles etc and zipped 3D-side pocket

## Pattern

- [Seamly file](./yellow-luggage.val)
- [60x40x20 params](./60x40x25.vit)
- [25x25x10 params](./25x15x10.vit)
- multipage [PDF](./yellow-luggage_pieces.pdf) and [SVG](./yellow-luggage_pieces.svg)
- [public domain licensed](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)

## What I'd change

- replace the curved zip line with a straight to create more tension (you can see the zip puffs out unnecessarily)
- de-bulk the straps before putting them in the flat-fell seam
- make a smaller version


## My version

- 60cm x 40cm x 25cm
- lightweight coated ripstop nylon
- tyvek lining
- main seams flat-felled
