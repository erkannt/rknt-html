Mindbendy way to see our world's map.

[Download the DXF](fuller-map-puzzle--rebuilt-3.dxf)

## Process and sources

I used various DXFs from the other projects on Thingiverse. I added puzzle cut outs and optimized curves to keep file size down.

- fits on 600x400 sheet
- separate layers for engraving and outlining the countries
- engraving layer split into three colours to avoid excess travel

There are sadly some bugs left in the puzzle e.g. superfluous holes.

## Laser settings

The example picture used the following passes:

- latitude and longitude lines with defocussed cut
- engrave passes at high speed, medium power, 0.08 stepover
- medium speed, medium power cut to outline the countries
- cut out the parts

Depending on your laser's bed you might need to support the material if you scale down the file to avoid pieces tipping up.
