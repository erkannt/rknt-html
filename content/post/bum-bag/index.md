## Learning and what I'd do different

- don't use cheap ribbon when you run out of webbing, it don't last
- there is probably a cleverer way to do the adjustable strap so that it can be tightened with a single hand
- if you like wearing in on your right hand side do the strap the other way round to make it easy to put on

## Construction

Basic order of operations:

- make front pocket
  - attach zip to extra piece of fabric that will become the top of the front panel
  - position zip on bottom part of front panel and stitch
  - trim the surplus fabric
  - don't forget to insert the zipper slider
  - construct darts, encasing the ends of the zip
	- attach the front pocket lining to the outer front pocket panel
- lining
	- inner pockets
	  - hem them
	  - attach to lining panels
	- assemble lining by stitching gusset between front and back lining (french seams for brownie points)
- construct outer shell
	- attach any webbing loops you desire to the panels
	- make the wings (follow the [Learn MYOG Everyday Fanny Pack](https://learnmyog.com/edcFannyPack.html) process for this)
	- assemble outer shell by sewing gusset to front and back panel (don't forget to attach the wings)
- final assembly
	- sew the lining to the outer after inserting them right sides together
	- leave a gap in the seam so that you can birth the bag
	- top stitch around the top to finish the bag
