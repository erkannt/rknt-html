title: OnePageRules Battleplans
---

Inspired by [ULC Battle Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhhRVgH-_E) this is how we currently play OnePageRules skirmish games using WarCry battleplan cards.

- fast setup as there are fewer decisions
- games feel unique
- encourages storytelling and a cinematic feel

## Process

1. Roll-off, winner decides if they want to be _Attacker_ or _Defender_
2. Starting with the _Defender_ take turns naming units as _Sword_, _Hammer_ or _Shield_  
   You must balance your models/toughness points as evenly as possible.  
	 <small>We place our minis on [this A4 tableu](./warcry-warband-tableu.svg).<br>This is also a great moment to explain your units stats and rules to the other player.</small>
3. Reveal the [Terrain card](#terrain)  
   <small>Shuffle until you have one that works for the terrain you've got.</small>
4. Reveal the _Deployment_ card  
   _Defender_ picks if they want to be _blue_ or _red_.
5. Reveal the _Victory_ card
6. Start playing, _Attacker_ has initiative

## Rules

Standard OnePageRules skirmish rules but:
- deployment and victory conditions are determined using Warcry Cards
- _Scout_ allows the unit to take a _Move_ action at the beginning of the round they are deployed in
- _Ambush_ units cannot deploy before round 2 or the round in which the card tells them to deploy. They may ignore the deployment position of the card and follow _Ambush_ deployment rules instead.

## Cards

### Terrain

{{ shuffle_cards(folder="terrain") }}



## Misc.

Recommendations:
- use _Kitchen Table_ distances and board size i.e. 2'x2' or 22"x30" board and halve all distances in the rules.
- follow _competitive validation_/_Force Org._ rules and play with 200pt armies

Ideas for further constraints:
- limit armies to one non-hero _Tough_ unit
- limit armies to 10/12 _Tough_ points/model counts
