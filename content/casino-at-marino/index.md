  The Casino at Marino is touted as
  <a href="http://casinomarino.ie/">Dublin’s Tardis</a> by its Office of
  Public Works and rightly so. Resembling a mausoleum when viewed from its
  approach, the interior manages to nest a large number of rooms for
  entertaining as well the service areas that go with such an endeavour.
</p>
<p>
  The history, inspiration and design are so weird that they have led to
  one brave soul

<p>
  For the Dublin Meeting of Design Students
  <a href="http://www.carsonandcrushell.com/">Douglas Carson</a> had
  proposed to direct tourist interest towards this architectural curiosity
  outside of Dublin.
</p>
<p>
  He had managed to not only organise several material sponsors but most
  importantly convinced Dublin Castle to host the installation. The castle
  garden is a stop on most tours of Dublin and so the plan was to
  construct a replica or hommage to the china room there.
</p>
<p>
  Sadly he wouldn’t be available to supervise and tutor the students in
  the workshop day to day. So Joana Martins and myself were spontaneously
  recruited as tutors for the project.
</p>
<p>
  The location of the Dublin castle gardens came with many hurdles. They
  didn’t want construction noise in the garden so we were prohibited from
  using any powertools. This led to the choice of a lashed timber
  structure as a means of construction. This is a common practice in
  scouting organisations around the world. The walls would be a novel
  weather proof MDF manufactured by a local company.
</p>
<p>
  Sadly the sponsored timber was much thicker than required and of quite
  limited quantity.
</p>

<p>
  We were very grateful to be provided with a space inside the castle were
  we could store materials and operate power tools. Once we moved to
  construction in the garden and hence the public eye the full brunt of
  the Irish health and safety circus hit us.
</p>
<p>
  We scrambled to organise hard hats, high vis and gloves for all
  students. Then we had to convince officials that students would be
  allowed to work in the garden without having ‘heavy lifting permits’.
  Once we got started lashing timbers, we were asked to obtain an
  assessment by a certified engineer and after setting up a painters
  platform for ease construction we were told that a ‘working at height’
  permit would be required. Also the platform was apparently scaffolding
  and should therefore only be assembled by someone with certification.
</p>
<p>
  All of this had left us quite frustrated and we ended up waiting for
  most of of week. In the end we erected the entire pavilion in a single
  Saturday, essentially when no one was there to complain ^^.
