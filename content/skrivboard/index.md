I designed and built this desk as part of the Design in Wood course at NTNU.

That year the course was held in collaboration with a timber and furniture
company. The brief was to come up with plans that people could execute
themselves after buying boards from the company.

This was pre-smartphone for me, so I have a single picture of the process: the
finished desk. I can't remember how I arrived at the cantilevered idea, but I
to this day really like it. I actually got to use it for several months when I
went back to Norway to to a short research project at SINTEF.
